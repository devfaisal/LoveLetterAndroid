# LoveLetterAndroid

This is an android implementation of the AEG published card game 'Love Letter'. This is a
'pass and play' version of the game ie. there is no AI. This is an alternative to the
physical card game. Players take their individual turns, playing a card and, when their turn
is complete, they pass the device to another player.
